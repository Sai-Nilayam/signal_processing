The 'h' sound is not here. We need to take a starting and ending 'h' sound. 
vve - means vyanjana varna ending sounds. 
vvs - means vyanjana varna starting sounds. 
sv_sme - menas swaravarna starting middle and ending sounds. 

the production idea 
--------
instead of going with the dummy words it is better go with original word (name) pronunciations to crop all the different sounds.
